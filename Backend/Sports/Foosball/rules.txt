• Winning Condition: The first team to score 10 goals wins the match.
• Time Limit: 20 minutes per match.
o If the time expires before a team reaches 10 goals, the team leading at the whistle wins.
o If scores are tied, a "Golden Goal" rule applies (next goal wins).
• Side Selection: A coin toss determines the starting side/possession. No side switching during a set.

Rules
1. Scoring: A goal counts anytime the ball enters the net, including own goals and deflections off any player.
2. No Spinning: Rotating the rod more than 360° is not allowed and results in immediate loss of possession.
3. No Spinning (Ball delivery): The ball should not be spun while putting it in after a goal or after a break.
4. Dead Ball: If the ball stops out of reach in a corner, re-serve.
5. Jarring: Banging, lifting, or sliding the table to affect the ball is not allowed.
6. Time Limit: You cannot hold the ball on a single rod for more than 15 seconds.
7. Ball Off Table: If the ball leaves the table, play restarts with a serve by the team that did not shoot it out.
8. Reset: Teams switch sides after every set; the loser of the previous game gets the first serve of the next game.
9. Invalid Goal: If one shoots and it goes in without touching any of the opponent's defenders, then it would not be considered as a goal.
