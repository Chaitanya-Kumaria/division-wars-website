• The decision of the referee will be final
• All standard rules of the 8-ball pool will apply
• Equipment will be provided.
• Scratching the Cue Ball: Pocketing the white cue ball or knocking it off the table is a foul.
• Hitting the Wrong Ball First:
Before groups are set (open table): It is a foul to hit the 8-ball first.
After groups are set (solids or stripes): You must hit one of your own group's balls first. Hitting an opponent's ball or the 8-ball first is a foul.
• No Rail Contact: On any shot (unless a ball is pocketed), after the cue ball hits the correct object ball, at least one ball (the cue ball or an object ball) must hit a cushion (rail).
• Touching a Ball Illegally: Touching any ball (cue ball or object ball) with your hand, clothing, or any part of the cue other than the tip during a shot is a foul.
• "Push Shot" or Double Hit: Hitting the cue ball more than once in a single shot, or pushing it with the cue tip for too long (a "push shot"), is a foul.
• Shooting While Balls are Moving: You must wait for all balls on the table to come to a complete stop before taking your shot.
• No Foot on the Floor: At least one foot must be touching the floor when you make a shot.
• Pocketing the 8-Ball Incorrectly: Pocketing the 8-ball at the wrong time (before all your other balls are gone) or in the wrong pocket (if calling shots) results in an immediate loss of game.
